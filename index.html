                    <h2>Deep Learning-based Approach for Variable Candidate Segmentation</h2>
                    <p>Medical image segmentations made by experts express a lot of variability. This variability can
                        reflect the underlying uncertainty which lies in the nature of medical data. During my master thesis I
                        developed a neural network architecture which was able to create diverse candidate segmentations for
                        one input image. For validation purposes, I built a web interface based on python's Flask library
                        and deployed it with Google App Engine and Google Cloud Storage. A clinician used this interface to
                        rate my candidate segmentations. Full doc on request.

                    <h2>Skull Stripping: An Active Learning Approach</h2>
                    <p>Two main challenges of automated image processing in medical image analysis are the heterogeneity of
                        the data and the scarcity of it. Although abundant data exists, labeling it is very time-consuming
                        and expensive. Therefore it is crucial to be able to train an algorithm with very few data. One
                        approach to this is active learning, where unlabeled samples are actively selected by certain
                        criteria and then used to train the deep network. With this approach it is possible to reach a good
                        performance without having to label all the data.

                    <h2>Connect 4: A Minimax Game Engine in C++ and Python</h2>
                    <p>What started as a private project for hands-on experience with game theory ended with a competition
                        C++ vs python. My first minimax algorithm with alpha-beta-pruning was written in Python. It could
                        easily compete against a mediocre human in the game of connect 4. It achieved a 4 moves look-ahead
                        within reasonable computation time (cpu) of 2-3 s. During a C++ module, I had the chance to come up
                        with a project. So I decided to compete against the Python implementation. What came out is a
                        200-times faster connect 4 engine with a look-ahead of 8 moves in 2s. For the pure joy of building it, I constructed
                        a hardware connect 4 bot which can play against a human in real life. <br>

                        I am aware that connect 4 is a solved and relatively easy game, but perfect to explore game theory.

                        melanoma detection. During a project of the master module "Advanced Topics in Machine Learning" we
                        created a pipeline for data augmentation and classification. The augmentation was carried out with a
                        variational autoencoder, followed by a generative adversarial network. Classification was then done
                        with a standard ResNet.
