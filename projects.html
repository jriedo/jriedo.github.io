                <h2>Deep Learning-based Approach for Variable Candidate Segmentation</h2>
                <p>Medical image segmentations made by experts express a lot of variability. This variability can
                    reflect the underlying uncertainty which lies in the nature of medical data. During my master thesis I
                    developed a neural network architecture which was able to create diverse candidate segmentations for
                    one input image. For validation purposes, I built a web interface based on python's Flask library
                    and deployed it with Google App Engine and Google Cloud Storage. A clinician used this interface to
                    rate my candidate segmentations.

                <h2>Skull Stripping: An Active Learning Approach</h2>
                <p>Two main challenges of automated image processing in medical image analysis are the heterogeneity of
                    the data and the scarcity of it. Although abundant data exists, labeling it is very time-consuming
                    and expensive. Therefore it is crucial to be able to train an algorithm with very few data. One
                    approach to this is active learning, where unlabeled samples are actively selected by certain
                    criteria and then used to train the deep network. With this approach it is possible to reach a good
                    performance without having to label all the data.

                <h2>Connect 4: A Minimax Game Engine in C++ and Python</h2>
                <p>What started as a private project for hands-on experience with game theory ended with a competition
                    C++ vs python. My first minimax algorithm with alpha-beta-pruning was written in Python. It could
                    easily compete against a mediocre human in the game of connect 4. It achieved a 4 moves look-ahead
                    within reasonable computation time (cpu) of 2-3 s. During a C++ module, I had the chance to come up
                    with a project. So I decided to compete against the Python implementation. What came out is a
                    200-times faster connect 4 engine with a look-ahead of 8 moves in 2s. For the pure joy of building it, I constructed
                    a hardware connect 4 bot which can play against a human in real life. <br>

                    I am aware that connect 4 is a solved and relatively easy game, but perfect to explore game theory.

                <h2>Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection: A Generative Approach</h2>
                <p>The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) sets up a challenge every year called "Skin
                    Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection". It aims at automated skin lesion classification and
                    melanoma detection. During a project of the master module "Advanced Topics in Machine Learning" we
                    created a pipeline for data augmentation and classification. The augmentation was carried out with a
                    variational autoencoder, followed by a generative adversarial network. Classification was then done
                    with a standard ResNet.

                    The first time I came in contact with conventional machine learning algorithms was during this lab
                    module of medical image analysis. With very simple implementations of random forests, support vector
                    machines and k-nearest-neighbor algorithms, we were able to achieve reasonable performance on the
                    task of brain matter segmenation.
